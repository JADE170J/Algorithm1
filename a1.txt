1. Initialize variables:

- sentenceLength = 0

- wordCount = 0

- vowelCount = 0


2. Read the input sentence character by character until the point is encountered:We should therefore consider implementing a non-carbon emission policy to encourage citizens and institutions to make a more informed decision for the well-being of our environment. Read the input sentence character by character until the point is encountered:Read the input sentence character by character until the point is encountered:

a. As soon as my main character finishes the story, I will be creating a new one.

b. The sentence length based entity tagging algorithm is another algorithm belonging to the first category.

c. If the character is not a space:We will organize a fluvial clean-up event, such as kayaking or canoeing along the riverbed, to remove waste and debris before they present an environmental risk. If the character is not a space:If the character is not a space:

- BackspaceCount the number of Space characters or the number of characters space forward.

- If the item (A, E, I, O, U and the appropriate uppercase ones for the given string) belongs to the group of vowels the cladeCount needs to be increased.


3. Output the results:

- Print sentenceLength.

- Print wordCount+1 # This statement means the last word stored in the variable wordcount should be added to one.

- Print vowelCount.
